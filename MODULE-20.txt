### Generics Answers:

1. Generics allow types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces, and methods.
2. They provide stronger type checks at compile time, eliminate type casting, and enable generic algorithms.
3. A class with a type parameter, allowing it to operate on objects of various types.
4. A placeholder for a type that is specified when the generic type is instantiated.
5. A method that can operate on objects of various types, specified using type parameters.
6. ArrayList is a raw type; ArrayList<T> is a parameterized type that provides type safety.

### IO Answers:

1. They are used to read and write data to and from a source, respectively.
2. Common methods include  write(int b) ,  write(byte[] b) , and  flush() .
3. The process of converting an object into a byte stream for storage or transmission.
4. A marker interface indicating that a class can be serialized.
5. The process of converting a byte stream back into a copy of the object.
6. By implementing the  Serializable  interface and using  ObjectOutputStream .
7. By using  ObjectInputStream  to read the byte stream and reconstruct the object.
8. Use the  transient  keyword to exclude certain fields from serialization.
9. Classes include  File ,  FileInputStream ,  FileOutputStream ,  FileReader , and  FileWriter .
10.  Externalizable  allows control over the serialization process;  Serializable  uses the default serialization mechanism.
