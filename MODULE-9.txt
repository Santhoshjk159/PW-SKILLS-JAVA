1.They are used when a condition comprises more than one boolean expression.
   The ternary operator (?:), logical AND (&&), and logical OR (||).

2.Unary (one operand), Binary (two operands), Ternary (three operands).

3.The switch statement tests a variable against multiple values, providing a cleaner alternative to multiple if-else statements.

4.(), *///%, +/- (highest to lowest).

5.if, if-else, and else-if ladder are used to execute code based on conditions.

6.if (condition) {
    // code if true
} else {
    // code if false
}

7.for, while, do-while.

8.for loop: Initialization, condition check, and increment/decrement are handled in one line; it checks the condition before executing the loop body.
do-while loop: Executes the loop body at least once before checking the condition, making it a post-test loop.

9.public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
