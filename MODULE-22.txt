1. Multithreading refers to the ability of a CPU or a single core in a multi-core processor to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently, allowing programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. It's important for improving the efficiency of programs by utilizing available resources effectively.

2. The benefits of using multithreading include improved responsiveness in user interfaces, better resource utilization, efficient handling of multiple tasks, and enhanced performance in multitasking environments.

3. A thread in Java represents a single path of execution in a program. It allows concurrent execution of different parts of a program.

4. There are two ways to implement threads in Java: by extending the Thread class or by implementing the Runnable interface.

5. The main difference between threads and processes is that threads share the same memory space, while processes have their own memory space.

6. Daemon threads in Java are threads that run in the background, providing services to other threads. They can be created by calling the setDaemon(true) method before starting the thread.

7. The wait() method causes a thread to wait until another thread notifies it, while the sleep() method causes the current thread to suspend execution for a specified period of time.
