3.Collections in Java are used to store and manipulate groups of objects, like lists and maps, while streams are used to process collections in a functional style, enabling operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing on the elements.

4.Enums in Java are special data types used to define a fixed set of constants. They are more robust than using integer constants because they provide type safety and can have behaviors associated with them.

5.Java provides many built-in functions, like   System.out.println()   for printing to the console,   Math.max()   for finding the maximum of two numbers, and   String.toLowerCase()   for converting a string to lowercase.
