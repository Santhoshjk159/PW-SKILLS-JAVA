1.The process of binding data and corresponding methods (behaviour) together into a single unit 
is called encapsulation in Java.

2.Data hiding, Abstraction,Access Control and Data integrity.

3.Setters and Getters  are used in Java to access and modify the private data members of a class.

4.this keyword refers to the current object or instance of a class. It is used to differentiate between 
instance variables and parameters or local variables that have the same name, and to pass the current object 
as a parameter to other methods or constructors.

5.(i)The encapsulated code is more flexible and easy to change with new requirements.
  (ii)It prevents the other classes from accessing the private fields.
  (iii)Encapsulation allows modifying implemented code without breaking other code who have implemented the code.

6.Encapsulation is achieved in Java by declaring the instance variables of a class as private
and providing public getter and setter methods to access and modify the values of these variables.
